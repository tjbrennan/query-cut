# query-cut
Chrome extension to copy current URL minus the query string

Tracking tokens in the query string annoy me when I try to share links. This extension cuts off the query string and copies the resulting URL to the clipboard. Be aware that it may remove important arguments as well. Per-site argument rules to be added in the future.
